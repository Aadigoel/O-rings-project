  # Dataset
  On the 28th of January 1986, 17% of the American population tuned in to watch the launch of the Challenger Space Shuttle. What was set to ba a moment of great joy, however, turned into one of grief and sorrow. The space shuttle exploded even before it left the Earth's atmosphere. This catastrophe changed the way NASA functioned, forcing them to be more open to scrutiny and advice from the scientific community. But why did this disaster happen?
  An investigating committee called the 'Rogers Commission' led by Richard Feynman
  
  # Model
  Regression analysis is a method that has long been used in statistics to determine and establish the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable(s).
  Linear regression is a technique in regression analysis that assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.  The aim of linear regression can be said to be to find that best-fit line for a given set of data points that helps us predict accurately what the value of the dependent variable should be, given the value of the independent variable.
